    <p><strong>WARNING</strong> This is an advanced function for administrators only.  The purpose is to delete requests
    which have failed for some reason not picked up by the software.  Outstanding requests will not be cancelled, but if
    you delete a request which is still active you will probably receive errors from the backend.</p>
    <p>Are you sure you want to delete "{{ object }}" ?</p>
    <p><input type="submit" value="Yes" /></p>
